  {
    question: "Can a matrix have multiple eigenvectors and eigenvalues?",
    answer: "Yes, absolutely! A matrix (specifically, an N x N square matrix) can have up to N distinct eigenvalues. Each eigenvalue can have one or more associated eigenvectors. These different eigenvector/eigenvalue pairs represent the different fundamental ways the matrix transformation stretches or shrinks space along specific directions."
  },
  {
    question: "Does every matrix have (real) eigenvectors?",
    answer: "Most square matrices do. However, some transformations, like a pure rotation in 2D (unless it's a 0, 180, or 360-degree rotation), might not have eigenvectors that are 'real' vectors (i.e., vectors with only real numbers). Their eigenvectors involve complex numbers. This means there isn't a direction in the real 2D plane that stays perfectly aligned after the rotation; every direction changes."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the zero vector considered an eigenvector?",
    answer: "By definition, eigenvectors must be non-zero vectors. While it's true that for any matrix A and any scalar λ, A * 0 = λ * 0 (since A * 0 is always 0), the zero vector doesn't tell us anything useful or unique about the transformation's special directions. We're interested in non-trivial directions that are preserved."
  },
  {
    question: "What if an eigenvalue is zero?",
    answer: "If an eigenvalue is zero, it means the matrix squashes any corresponding eigenvector down to the zero vector. This is significant because it implies the matrix is 'singular' – it doesn't have an inverse, and it collapses some part of the space."

            For eigenvalues and eigenvectors, this means we won't just say "Av = λv". We'll ask:

              Usually, when a matrix transforms a vector, the vector gets knocked off its original path – its direction changes.

              These vectors might get longer, shorter, or even flip to point in the exact opposite direction, but they would still lie along the <em>same line</em> as they did before the transformation.

              The answer to our core question is YES! Those "special" non-zero vectors are called <strong>eigenvectors</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Eigenvector (from First Principles):</strong> An eigenvector of a matrix is a non-zero vector that, when the matrix transformation is applied to it, results in a new vector that still points along the same line (same or exactly opposite direction) as the original eigenvector. Only its length (magnitude) might change.
            </p>
            <p>
              Think of them as the "characteristic directions" or "invariant lines" of a matrix transformation.

              <strong>Eigenvalue (from First Principles):</strong> For a given eigenvector, its corresponding eigenvalue is the numerical factor by which the eigenvector's length is multiplied when the matrix transformation is applied.
